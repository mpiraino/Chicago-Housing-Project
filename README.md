We are exploring the housing market in Chicago. The housing market has always fluctuated over the years. Every year each area gets reassessed and aspects of the neighborhood affect the cost of housing and the value of properties in the city. There are  some price disparities all over the city within each zoning group. The data we pulled will display the city of Chicago and each neighborhood showing the price ranges across the city and in each “district”.

We proposed to create a choropleth map that shows all neighborhoods in Chicago. We wanted to obtain information on the average cost of a house in each area as well as the outlining higher and lower values in each. There will be color ranges with the lowest average displaying “orange” then the highest average being “red”. We wanted to show how neighboring townships can have a wide range between the two even though they are in the same vicinity. 

We also want to visualize how the cost and sale of these properties are changing over time. We intend to create a line  graph that displays the average sale price of each neighborhood over the last seven years.  There will be a summary table that outlines: number of properties, average sale price, the max and min sale price in each neighborhood as well as the standard deviation of housing costs. We feel having this visual will layout the outliers in each neighborhood. Especially in neighborhoods that have a high average cost.

There are some  questions we have that our data may be able to answer. Based on what we know of the city, are the pricing of houses in Chicago shocking? Are there some areas more expensive than you feel they should be? Why are there such high disparities in neighboring zones? What else does our data tell us that may not be obvious upon looking at the map?
